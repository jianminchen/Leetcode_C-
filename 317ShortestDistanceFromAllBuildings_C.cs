    * Leetcode 317:
    * You want to build a house on an empty land which reaches all buildings in the shortest amount 
    * of distance. You can only move up, down, left and right. You are given a 2D grid of values 0, 1 or 2, 
    * where:
       Each 0 marks an empty land which you can pass by freely.
       Each 1 marks a building which you cannot pass through.
       Each 2 marks an obstacle which you cannot pass through.
       For example, given three buildings at (0,0), (0,4), (2,2), and an obstacle at (0,2):
   1 - 0 - 2 - 0 - 1
   |   |   |   |   |
   0 - 0 - 0 - 0 - 0
   |   |   |   |   |
   0 - 0 - 1 - 0 - 0
    * 
    * The point (1,2) is an ideal empty land to build a house, as the total travel distance of 3+3+1=7 is 
    * minimal. So return 7.
    * 
    * code reference:
    * http://buttercola.blogspot.ca/2016/01/leetcode-shortest-distance-from-all.html
    * 
    * Analysis from the above blog:
    * Note:
       There will be at least one building. If it is not possible to build such house according to       
       the above rules, return -1.
       Understand the problem:
       A BFS problem. Search from each building and calculate the distance to the building. 
    *  One thing to note is an empty land must be reachable by all buildings. To achieve this, 
    *  maintain an array of counters. Each time we reach a empty land from a building, increase the 
    *  counter. Finally, a reachable point must have the counter equaling to the number of buildings. 
    *  
    * Julia's comment on January 19, 2016:
    * 1. let us do the following:
       A. First, get the number of building in total - integer
       B. Get all the building into a data structure - a list - each one is (i,j) coordinate
       C. Then, go through each building, we need to report two things:
      distance[i][j], where 0 <= i < n, 0 <= j < n
      reach[i][j],    where 0 <= i < n, 0 <= j < n 
      How to do it? using BFS search 
      We need to put all the distance array, reach[i][j] into list as well, so we can sum the value, 
      compare to number of building - reachable, 
      And then, get the minimum distance. 
      Four direction of BFS search. 
      BFS search main points: 
      do not visit twice, avoid dead loop 
      Four direction for next move. 
      Base case of BFS:
      1. in the range of matrix 
      2. is not the building node - original starter
      3. is land node
      Task: distance to building, current distance, two arrays, one queue 
      So, based on the above 3 cases - design the function to do BFS
      arguments: 
      original node (x, y), new node (x1, y1), 
      Discussion: 
       1. Think about ideas: 
         A1: finding all buildings, go through each one, do BFS 
         A2: find all empty land, go through each land, and then, find land's distance to each of building. 
     
        Argue A1 and A2, difference between them.      
        
    *  January 19, 2016 8:00pm - 9:30pm - work on coding more than 1 hour
    *  BFS is hard algorithm to write. 
    *  How to shorten the time to 20 minutes? 
    *  
    *  Take more than 20 minutes to go over code to fix bugs before compiling - read the code, check variable scope, etc. 
    *  Look up jagged array initialization - learn using new int[] inside first dimension array {}
