         * Problem: Leetcode 99 - recover binary search tree

         * 
         * julia's comment:
         * 1. Extract two functions: 
         *    findTheInorderPredecessorOfCurrent
         *    violationChecking        
         * 
         * 2. Add test cases for those two functions, 
         *    make them memorizable, testable, maintainable
         *   
         * 3. online judge passes
         *  1916 / 1916 test cases passed.
	        Status: Accepted
            Runtime: 324 ms
         * 
         * 4. Read the code, and write down the script: 
         * Actually it is in Morris order traversal, not using stack; use the existing right 
         * child pointer connect the traversal nodes, later revert the change. 
         * 
         * First, use two violation nodes, 3 nodes: current node, previous node, parent node to help
         * tracking the inorder traversal process. 
         * 
         * base case discussion: root node is null, return
         * start from root node, get in a loop, 
         * 
         * if node in the loop (ith)'s left child is null, then, 
         * do a violation checking function call using parent node (pa), ith node input arguments, 
         * after the call, recover phase: ith node is set as pa node, ith.right is ith node (go to its right child).
         * using example to explain: 
         *     1 
         *      \
         *       3
         *      / \ 
         *      2  4
         *    starting from root node (1), (1)'s left child is empty, and then, before moving to next node:
         *    (1)'s right child (3), do violation check, and then, set ith's node to (3), and parent node as ith's node (1). 
         * 
         * else if ith's left child is not null, then, 
         * find predecessor node  of ith's node, denoted as previous node (pr), 
         * if pr's right child is null, then, threaded link is not set up, 
         * so, set up the link before moving to ith's node's next one - its left child
         * using example to explain the work here:
         *       4
         *      /
         *     2
         *    / \ 
         *    1  3
         *    starting from root node (4), (4)'s left child is not null, and then, find its inorder 
         *    predecessor node (3), 
         *     case A: node (3)'s right child is not set up to node (4), then, 
         *     set up node (3)'s right = node (4), move ith's node's left node, node (2). 
         *     
         *     case B: node (3)'s right child is already set up to node (4), then
         *     revert the change, (3).right = null
         *     do violation check, parent node pa, ith node, 
         *     recover phase: set parent node pa as ith node, and then, move to ith's right node. 
         *     
         *     What we miss here, Morris order second visit of node 4. how to do traversal? 
         *     visit (4), then, set up (3)'s right = (4), so, continue to travel, 4->2. 
         *     output of inorder traversal only happens two cases: 
         *       one is to travel fake link, right child; second one is to travel to its right child.  
         *     
         *
