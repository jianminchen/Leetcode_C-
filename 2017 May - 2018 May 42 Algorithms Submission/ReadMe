I submitted 42 algorithms from May 2017 to May 2018 using Leetcode online judge. 

Every algorithm there is a story behind. I spent a lot of hours to work on those 42 algorithms. It is good idea to review those algorithms, and try to apply them in the work, mock interview.  
 
Here is [the pdf file](https://github.com/jianminchen/Leetcode_C-/blob/master/Practice%20statistics/LeetcodeQuestions%20May%209%202018%20Last%2012%20months.pdf) containing all algorithms I submitted last 12 month. 42 algorithms are submitted. 



I write something about how many algorithm I should have completed in 12 months. The most important is to get into detail on one algorithm, for example, I should look into more ideas like slide window maximum algorithm. 

Here is [the blog I wrote on this topic](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.com/2018/06/leetcode-last-12-months-42-algorithm.html).
