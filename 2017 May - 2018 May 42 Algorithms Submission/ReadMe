I submitted 42 algorithms from May 2017 to May 2018 using Leetcode online judge. 

Every algorithm there is a story behind. I spent a lot of hours to work on those 42 algorithms. It is good idea to review those algorithms, and try to apply them in the work, mock interview. 

Here is the pdf file containing all algorithms I submitted last 12 month. 42 algorithms are submitted.
