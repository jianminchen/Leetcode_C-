# Leetcode_C-

Starting from September 3, 2015, I started my first practice on Leetcode algorithms. 

Leetcode problems solving using c# programming language. 

[The leetcode questions](http://juliachencoding.blogspot.ca/2015/08/leetcode-questions-and-web-link.html) are listed on this webpage of julia coding blog as well if you like to look up.
