         * Given a set of non-overlapping intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals (merge if necessary).

            You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

            Example 1:
            Given intervals [1,3],[6,9], insert and merge [2,5] in as [1,5],[6,9].

            Example 2:
            Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] in as [1,2],[3,10],[12,16].

            This is because the new interval [4,9] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].

         * Julia's comment: 
         * 1. First, review the thought process:
         *    Go over all the intervals one by one; In each iteration, 
         *    compare to the two intervals.
         *    
         *    3 cases:
         *    case 1: the interval ends before new interval starts ->
         *      action: add the interval to the return result container
         *      
         *    case 2: the interval starts after new interval ends ->
         *      action: add new interval to the return result container, 
         *      and set the interval as the new one
         *      
         *    case 3: the interval overlaps with new interval -> 
         *      action: merge two intervals, and save it as 
         *      new interval. 
         *      
         * 2. Secondly, the code has a few of issues. Let us improve the code. 
         *    1. Abstract code, no more interval word in variable name; 
         *    2. Make it easy to go over test cases; 
         *       Case stands out easily in the code. 
         *       Code is more testable. 
         *    
         *    step 1: Make the function a simple math, not interval business.  
         *    step 2: Two intervals, R1 (stands for come and go one in the loop), 
         *    R2 (stand for extra range for next iteration). 
         *    
         *    tip: R2 one can be understandable by going through the test cases:
         *    Given [1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16], insert and merge [4,9] in as [1,2],[3,10],[12,16]
         *    R1       R2
         *    [1,2]    [4,9]   -> R1 is added to return container: {[1,2]}
         *    [3,5]    [4,9]   -> R1 and R2 overlaps, then, R2 = [3,9] 
         *    [6,7]    [3,9]   -> R1 and R2 overlaps, then, R2 = [3,9]
         *    [8,10]   [3,9]   -> R1 and R2 overlaps, then, R2 = [3, 10]
         *    [12, 16] [3,10]  -> R2 is added to return container, so it is {[1,2],[3,10]}; 
         *                        R2 = R1 = [12, 16]
         *    Now add R2 to the return container, so the result: {[1,2], [3,10], [12, 16]}
